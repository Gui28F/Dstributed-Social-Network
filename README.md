In this work, a distributed social network similar to Mastodon was developed. In this social network, there is a set of domains (servers in Mastodon terminology).

A user will have an account in a domain, which will allow him to interact with users of that and other domains. Each domain manages user profiles registered in that domain. Each user can change their profile information and has a message feed. A user posts new messages to his feed and can retrieve the message from his feed (or other users' feed).
In addition, the user can subscribe to other users even if they are registered in another domain - the sending of requests is always done by contacting your Mastodon server.
